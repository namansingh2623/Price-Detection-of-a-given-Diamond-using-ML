## FINAL YEAR UNDERGRADUATE PROJECT- PRICE DETECTION OF A GIVEN DIAMOND USING ML

### OVERVIEW
we created a model and a user-friendly website “Storia Lucet” that will calculate the right price for the given diamond. This model will help the retailers to set the suitable prices and customers to get the right prices.

### MODELS USED
Regression techniques are one of the most popular techniques used in data mining and predictive modelling. These can be integrated to determine or predict the correct prices of a diamond. Some of the regression algorithms used are
1) Multiple Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Decision Tree Regression

### DATASET
The dataset which is used in this project is a diamond dataset that is available on Kaggle with approximately 54000 rows and 10 properties including the price of the diamond. The results show the predicted price calculated by the regression algorithms. It also helps us to know which properties are more correlated with the price.
